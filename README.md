1-In the terminal insert (npm start)  
2-_8000 port will be used as a local host.



1- My plan for completing this project was to use the MVC design pattern.
The controller will link the View and the Model to receive user inputs and manage user callback interactions.
I constructed the model  to manage the data of the application , and the view has the important info to control the rendering files which implemented by the handlebars and the HTML.

2- I used Mysql previously, despite the fact that it's a non relational database which I used to work with, working with MongoDB, was interesting.
MongoDB was quicker for me since it supports a lot of unstructured-data, have more configurable document.


3- I was mostly impressed with the architecture of the application , which is simple to understand and adapt.Nevertheless, the frontend aspect of the task might be enhanced. But the primary concept of the project is to manage backend as well as the database. Instead, I focused my attention on those areas.

4- The of this work is that I gained a better understanding of how to link both apps  MongoDB database. I got more at confidence when it came to deal and handle Sessions.
I gained a better understanding of Node.js. I covered how to protect data by hiding it behind authentication rather than making it publicly available. I further experienced how to link the account to the user. The task was difficult to complete and took a long time to make it done.
